With this workshop, I learned how to do the usual and basic procedure in this program such as the way to use the print function which is a common use in this type of course. Also how to print out, the use of libraries for print out in C and to make the program to compile. Besides, I learned how to submit the workshop on Matrix and transfer files from my computer which is very useful for my future assigments.
