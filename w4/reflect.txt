1)	In one or two sentences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements? 

Because it is the maximum of days that we are trying to display in the program, and the number 10 represents the size of the array.

3)	Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 

For me it was a little bit too hard because I spend a lot of time thinking how to do it and what type of loops should I use and how can I make the program stop after the user enter a negative number, with the little knowledge that I had I couldn’t do it by myself so I had to investigate and ask friends for advice in order to do the at home part.
