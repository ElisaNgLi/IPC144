1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?
a)how to use the different expressions to do the calculation 
b)the importance of the specifier, because if we don't put it then it won’t show when we run the program
c)the difference between the integer division and modulus

2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?

The reason we added is because we don't need to rounded up the number after the final result, if we don't add 0.005 to calculate the GST it will be truncated to a number we are not looking for, since a program won’t rounded up automatically, we have to do the operation. 
  
3- What is the result of a casting operation?

Without the casting operation our output will result in 0 no matter what we put as an input, that’s why we have to use it if we want our output to show the result that we are working for.

4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

To practice the different ways that we can do the calculation so we don’t stick to a single way to do a program and to know the differences between an integer division and modulus. With this workshop I realize that they are many ways that we can do a simple calculation in a program.
