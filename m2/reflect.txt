1.	Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members. 

I think it is because this way we can practice the use of pointers and functions

2.	What was the most difficult part of this assignment? 

The most difficult part was the Milestone 4, trying to understand how to do it and the logic behind it. It was a little bit difficult at the beginning, I have to research a lot in order to understand completely how to do the program.

3.	How long did it take you to complete Milestone 4? 

It took me almost all the weekend to finish the Milestone 4. I encounter some errors in my code and I was trying to fix it but eventually I did.
